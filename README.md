## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to help pizza business sustain and enhance their business growth. 
The analysis will help business owner understands their current product performance and uncover valuable 
insights to make data-driven decisions

## Problem Statement
To identify business growth opportunities, the pizza business owner needs to understand their product performance -
their data sales in order to execute growth plans such as marketing, promotions, or product optimization.

To generate insights, I developed Power BI dashboard monitoring key performance metrics using these
questions:

1. What is the total revenue over a specific period?
2. How many pizzas have been sold in total?
3. What is the average order amount?
4. Which pizza names are the most and least popular by order?
5. Which pizza names have the highest and lowest quantity sold?
6. Which pizza sizes are most preferred by customers?
7. Which pizza categories generate the most sales?
8. What are the daily and monthly sales trends?
9. How do sales vary across pizza categories and sizes?

## Data Analysis Process and Documentation
In the data preparation and quality assessement, the relational model is adopted to store and access structured information.
I used tructured query language (SQL) to write and query data to:
  1. Perform data cleaning, aggregation, and then processing tasks within Power BI.
  2. Cross-validating analytical results between SQL query outputs and Power BI DAX-based calculations
  3. Documented the queries and their results in Google Docs to monitor and improve query performance and management tasks
